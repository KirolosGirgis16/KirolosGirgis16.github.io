            <h1>My First Feedback</h1><br>
            <hr>
            <h2>I recieved my first feedback on my Who Am I assignment in the first week. You can read it down below.
                <br><br>
                <!--this is to make it like a textblock-->
                <p class="pfeed">
                    Hello Kirolos, <br>welcome to our program! I have written down some notes and feedback about your
                    "who am I" document. Don't worry about answering all of that just yet. Just keep it in mind for your
                    first website and your further personal development.
                    <br><br>
                    Good to hear about your motivation to learn more about IT. This study focusses more on technical
                    espects of IT. It should be a bit more hands on instead of the more theory based studies you might
                    be used to. I am curious which part of IT interests you so much to where you decided to aim for an
                    IT job. Maybe you can explain that a little more in the website you will be making.
                    <br><br>
                    It's understandable that you don't have a clear job type you are aiming for yet. During the program
                    you will get a lot more insight into the field of IT. This will help you make an informed decission
                    in the future. Also as you might already know there are a lot of job opportunities in IT so you will
                    probably have companies offering you jobs before the end of your study.
                    <br><br>
                    Don't worry about the planning issues you currently have. Start thinking about ways to avoid running
                    into these issues during your courses/projects. You'll be working on planning and other "soft
                    skills" (non technical skills) during your studies.
                    <br><br>
                    For your question about visiting other coutries. Yes there are quite a few programs that you can
                    join to go abroad. For example the student association organises a trip abroad once a year. And
                    there will be an international week in the future. All these trips will be communicated in time
                    through email or in class.
                    <br><br>
                    Kind regards,
                    <br><br>
                    Gijs van den Abeele
                    <br>
                </p>
                <br><br>
                Thank you Gijs van den Abeele for the feedback, I am very interested in IT because i like the way IT can
                solve many issues and i think that IT will always grow. Of course i will solve my problem with planning.
                I am very enthousiastic in regards to the travelling part, because i like to travel the world.
